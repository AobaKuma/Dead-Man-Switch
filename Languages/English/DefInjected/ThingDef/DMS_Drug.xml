  <Neuroglue.description>A protein-like receptor gel which mediates both biological tissues and neural machinery, in order to effectively block phantom limb syndrome and synthetic rejection. It also blocks nanomechanical infections.

Such products have been circulating Rimworld and Midworld planets for many decades, but any organization claiming to have produced this product has been sanctioned by agents from the Coreworlds. They declare that such a product will increase the level of bionic-enhanced pirates which isn't safe for the dire regional balance of security.</Neuroglue.description>
