  <!-- EN: An array machine process recived signal. these signal be direction to a specific mechanitor. This will add 4 bandwidth to that mechanitor's total bandwidth, allowing them to control more mechanoids.\n\nOnce a process array is constructed, it can be quickly tuned to a mechanitor. However, retuning a band node to a different mechanitor takes significantly longer. -->
