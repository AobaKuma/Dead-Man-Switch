  <DMS_BandNode.description>An array machine that processes the received signal and directs it to a specific mechanitor. This will add 4 bandwidth to that mechanitor's total bandwidth, allowing them to control more mechanoids.

Once a process array is constructed, it can be quickly tuned to a specific mechanitor. However, returning a band node to a different mechanitor takes significantly longer.

This device only follows the N.A.C.S. protocol to operate, so only a similar mechlink with the following protocol can receive the signal.</DMS_BandNode.description>
