  <DMS_BandNode.description>An array machine processes the received signal and directs to a specific mechanitor. This will add 4 bandwidth to that mechanitor's total bandwidth, allowing them to control more mechanoids.

Once a process array is constructed, it can be quickly tuned to a mechanitor. However, returning a band node to a different mechanitor takes significantly longer.

This Device followed the N.A.C.S. protocol to operate, so only Mechlink with the following protocol can revice the service.</DMS_BandNode.description>
