  <DMS_Army.description>A group of organized mercenaries, of which the core members are mostly non-commissioned officers and amateur militiamen in the colonial fleet. They take on any job, from cargo escort to insect hive clearing. And if you can afford it, they won't mind taking down a fortress with some heavy firepower.</DMS_Army.description>
