    <label>Weapon system</label>
    <helpText>Apparently you'll be able to create mechs that can customize weapons. Note that these mechs usually have restrictions on the weapons that can be equipped. You can view all the weapons supported by the mech in the weapon system properties in the infocard.</helpText>

    <label>Autonomous production</label>
    <helpText>Automated production tables are somewhat different from ordinary work tables. Their operation are more similar to Mech Gestator. That is, after inputting materials and initialization, the colonists can do other things. Only periodic reset of the initialization process is required to complete the manufacturing.</helpText>

    <helpText>Drones are an early type of mechs that does not rely on mechanitor. They rely on remote control platforms and operator control, also having limited battery. You can command the Drone to return to the platform to replenish the platform and allow the Drone to be repaired and the battery recharged.</helpText>

    <label>Heavy weapon</label>
    <helpText>Obviously you got a very heavy weapon. These weapons are not designed for direct use or even not useable by human, so you may need a person or equipped with exoskeleton or a dedicated mech to equip these kind of weapons. The specific equipment conditions can be checked in the weapon's infocard</helpText>
